Mock Firebolt: Control Plane Browser Extensions
===============================================

This folder contains these browser extensions:

- **governor/**
	 - A simple way to send Firebolt lifecycle events to an app via Mock Firebolt


NOTE: The plugins use the RESTful API of the Mock Firebolt server in the same way that the CLI and web admin app (served by the same NodeJS Express server that serves the Mock Firebolt control plane API).
